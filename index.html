					<h2>My First Website!! WOOOOOT!!!</h2>
					<h5>Fun moments and lessons along the way, June 3, 2022</h5>
					<div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
					<p>Finally, I made a website! Wow, what a great first post...but yes, I am so proud to have made
						this from scratch using only HTML and CSS ^_^. As I learned these languages, I used my own
						website as an experiment so I could test out things (like tables!) and things I always
						wanted (like a text overlay on hover). What was fun? Choosing colors and texts! Adding media
						queries for responsive layouts (still working on the "Resume" page). What was hard? Firstly,
						positioning the
						nav bar on the right side horizontally. Took some googling and flex-boxing to realize list items
						need
						an in-line display NOT the unordered list. The text-overlay on hover was probably the most
						difficult. I already had the
						images laid out in columns and then researched for the code. It's amazing that you can search
						for pretty much any web layout or animation online and find the code for it. What's not so
						amazing but also a good way to learn is when these lines of code don't work for you, lol. After
						tweaking so many details and the overlay STILL not fitting the image sizes perfectly, I combined
						two
						different methods I found online because each method wasn't working for me on its own. Do you
						ever struggle and tweak so many things that when it finally works, you feel like it's a miracle
						and don't want to touch it for fear it will fall apart? Well that's how I feel with this
						overlay. I look at the code now and honestly don't remember the exact change that finally fixed
						it (maybe I forgot a semicolon...) but I'm just happy it works :-D What's next? As I continue
						learning, I'll remember to blog more about resources I found online and just be more specific
						and concise. This was a spontaneous post, so don't expect professionalism! Ok, peace. </p>
