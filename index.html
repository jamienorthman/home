					<h2>My First Website!! WOOOOOT!!!</h2>
					<h5>Fun moments and lessons along the way, June 3, 2022</h5>
					<div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
					<p>Finally, I made a website! Wow, what a great first post...but yes, I am so proud to have made
						this from scratch using only HTML and CSS ^_^. As I learned these languages, I used my own
						website as an experiment so I could test out things (like tables!) and things I always
						wanted (like a text overlay on hover). What was fun? Choosing colors and texts! Adding media
						queries for responsive layouts (still working on the "Resume" page). What was hard? Firstly,
						positioning the
						nav bar on the right side horizontally. Took some googling and flex-boxing to realize list items
						need
						an in-line display NOT the unordered list. The text-overlay on hover was probably the most
						difficult. I already had the
						images laid out in columns and then researched for the code. It's amazing that you can search
						for pretty much any web layout or animation online and find the code for it. What's not so
						amazing but also a good way to learn is when these lines of code don't work for you, lol. After
						tweaking so many details and the overlay STILL not fitting the image sizes perfectly, I combined
						two
						different methods I found online because each method wasn't working for me on its own. Do you
						ever struggle and tweak so many things that when it finally works, you feel like it's a miracle
						and don't want to touch it for fear it will fall apart? Well that's how I feel with this
						overlay. I look at the code now and honestly don't remember the exact change that finally fixed
						it (maybe I forgot a semicolon...) but I'm just happy it works :-D What's next? As I continue
						learning, I'll remember to blog more about resources I found online and just be more specific
						and concise. This was a spontaneous post, so don't expect professionalism! Ok, peace. </p>

					<h2>Why I started learning to code</h2>
					<h5>Title description, Oct 25, 2022</h5>
					<div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
					<p>One of the reasons I started learning to code was because I don't like what the internet has become. 
						Nowadays, everything is laid out for you with templates and libraries. You actually don't have to 
						learn to code to build a website. In one way, it makes building a website more accessibile to people 
						with no coding experience. It can also come in handy if you need to do a project in a strict time frame 
						but it takes the control AND the fun out of creating something. I started learning more HTML and CSS because 
						I was sick of the limitations I faced within CMSes like Wordpress's Elementor or blog websites where you can 
						"choose a template." I wanted more creative freedom. Most of all, I wanted to do something different.</p>
					<p>A passion I have is collecting words I don't like, whether they are academic or overused words or euphemisms
						and talking about them with other people. I wanted to take this passion into an online space that people
						could contribute to but not just a discord channel or a standard website. I had the idea of making an 
						internet art piece, using a website as the medium so-to-speak. The project started off with mostly old 
				        HTML code I hadn't done since the early 00s, like the 'marquee' tag to make text scroll. Then I started 
						applying new HTML and CSS properties I learned such as forms, class attributes, and tooltips. The project
						focuses just on euphemisms now and, while still very much in its infancy, contains Javascript. Javascript
						is the first programming language I've ever learned--and am still learning! It is by far, the biggest 
						hurdle so far in my web development journey, and to be fair it's just a huuuuge subject to cover.
					</p>
					<p>My point is that despite my frustrations with learning CSS grid layouts, it is way more satisfying for me to
					   build a website from scratch. I am understanding these fundamental tools much better and just the way things 
					   work!--independently and together :)  If I use a template or even rely too much on a library like Bootstrap, 
					   I won't know how to debug if there is an issue because I DIDN'T BUILD THE FOUNDATION MYSELF. That just makes
					   me uncomfortable and even more frustrated in the end. I also feel limited in my creativity and coding is one
					   of the few things that I can experiment with, making it my own to then share with the world :-)
