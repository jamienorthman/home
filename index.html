						As someone who was first online in the early 2000s, I always enjoyed
						building my own part of the internet even with just a little HTML.
						Never associating myself with being a "coder", I persued my other interests in 
						the humanities and media, working for art publications and institutions. Feeling 
						unfulfilled, I rediscovered my love for coding and enjoyed not only the creative
						expression, but also the direct impact I was making through developing useful tools.
					</p>
					<p class="overview-text">
						Through various online resources such as The Odin Project, Scrimba, and Udemy, I have learned how to write 
						accessible, more-readable code and make fully responsive websites and apps. 
						I am continuously learning essential problem-solving skills needed 
						for programming the tools to help people work better. My childhood fascination 
						with the internet has never left me and I am always curious about what new 
						or alternative technologies are out there.
